h1. XNMaths.framework

Provides:

 * Matrix and Vector classes, some vector and matrix operations.
 * Linear equation systems solving
 * 2D function drawing with Graphable protocol (that should be probably renamed).
 * Approximation algorythms such as newton, lagrange interpolations, linear and cubic splines.

Depends on:

 * PHGraph.framework is used for 2D graph rendering. The framework will be bundled in this repository.

Used in:

 * My lab works for Calculus of Approximations course in Moscow State University of Aviation.

h2. What's next

Todo: 

* Naming conventions. I mean: What types to use? create my own float / double / point aliases? 
* Define 2D/3D semantics. What's 2D? Is f(x) a 2D function? It's OneArgumentFunction, not 2DFunction i think since it returns a value, not a point. 
* Dependencies and plotting. PHGraph is slow. Recalculating function on every point IS slow. Using PLPlot + SurfaceData / LineData can solve the issue. 
* Remove PHGraph dependency, remove stupid protocols with it. 
* Speedup calculations by using BLAS/LAPACK from vecLib.
