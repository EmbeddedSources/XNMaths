h1. XNMaths.framework

Provides:

 * Matrix and Vector classes, some vector and matrix operations.
 * Linear equation systems solving
 * 2D function drawing with Graphable protocol (that should be probably renamed).
 * Approximation algorythms such as newton, lagrange interpolations, linear and cubic splines.

Depends on:

 * PHGraph.framework is used for 2D graph rendering. The framework will be bundled in this repository.

Used in:

 * My lab works for Calculus of Approximations course in Moscow State University of Aviation.

h2. What's next

I plan to migrate matrix and vector routines to use Apple's vecLib since it's much, much faster. Using LAPACK and BLAS will also be a great plus.
